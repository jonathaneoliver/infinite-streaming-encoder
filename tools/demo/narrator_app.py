"""Narration editor: scrub a recording, edit its captions, hear the voice, export.

点 The loop this exists to invert: every text change used to cost an ffmpeg pass
before you could see it. Here the caption is a DOM element positioned over the
video's caption strip, so an edit renders instantly and correctly placed, and
the generated speech plays against the video at its own cue time. Rendering
stops being part of editing and becomes a single Export at the end.

General over recordings: point it at any video + cues.json pair.

    python3 narrator_app.py --video demo.mp4 --cues cues.json [--port 8777]

Reuses the pipeline scripts rather than reimplementing them — sentence splitting,
pause insertion and clip caching all come from narrate_sentences, so what you
hear in the browser is what Export writes.
