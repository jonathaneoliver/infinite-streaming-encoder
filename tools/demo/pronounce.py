"""Written text -> spoken text.

Written and spoken are not the same string. "4K" reads as "four K", "1h 39m" as
"one hour thirty nine minutes", and `ffmpeg` as the letters — and the engine
gets every one of them wrong left alone.

Its own module because it is the one part of the demo tooling with a
*correctness* property rather than a taste one, so it is the one part that can
have a test. `scripts/test_demo_pronunciation.py` pins it. Everything else here
is judged by watching the video.

The spoken form is DERIVED from the caption text, never read from a stored
`spoken` field. With both stored, editing `text` changed the caption and left
the voice saying the old line — the edit appears to do nothing audible. One
editable field, one source of truth.

## Ordering

The rules are applied in sequence, so order can matter — but far less than it
looks, and the difference is worth knowing before you rearrange anything.

**One ordering is load-bearing: the de-pluralising tail must stay LAST.** It
exists to repair `1 hours` / `1 minutes` / `1 seconds` left by the expansions
above it, so a rule added after it is unrepaired. Moving those three to the
front yields "1 hours 39 minutes", and the test pins that.

**Most of the rest is held by `\\b`, not by order.** `fMP4` is not shadowed by
the later `\\bMP4\\b` because there is no word boundary between `f` and `M` —
swapping the two changes nothing. The same goes for the acronyms generally.
This was originally documented here as an ordering hazard for both; writing the
test disproved it.

`\\b(\\d+)h (\\d+)m\\b` is **redundant** — the bare `\\b(\\d+)h\\b` and
`\\b(\\d+)m\\b` rules produce the identical result on every compound tested,
because the de-pluralising tail repairs what the split leaves. It is kept
because it states the intent legibly and costs one `re.sub`, not because
removing it would change output.

## Extending it for another project

`SPEECH` is this project's vocabulary — `apple-uniq-live-xs` and `VBV` mean
nothing elsewhere. A second project adds its own terms through
`DEMO_PRONOUNCE` (a file of `pattern<TAB>replacement` lines) rather than by
editing this table, so the two do not fork.

Extras are spliced in **before** the de-pluralising tail, so an extra that
emits "1 hours" is repaired to "1 hour" for free. Note what that does NOT buy:
the duration rules have already run by then, so an extra emitting a raw "1m"
comes out as "1m". Emit the expanded form and let the tail fix the plural, or
emit the finished string.
